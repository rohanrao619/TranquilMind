# TranquilMind

## Immersive Realities Hackathon

Unfortunately Git does not allow a public free repo > 1GB; and our project turned out to be 4GB. <br>
GitLab does allow TUM personnel 10GB repositories, and that is where we have now stored the Unity project. Please find the link here: https://gitlab.lrz.de/00000000014B4CC8/TranquilMindVR (Gitlab is only accessible with a TUM id, and you will have to request access, which we are of course happy to provide)
